  .orderBy('dateCreated ASC')
  .all() %}
```

```php

<h4 id="product-prefersites"><a href="#product-prefersites" class="header-anchor">#</a> <code>preferSites</code></h4>

If [unique](#product-unique) is set, this determines which site should be selected when querying multi-site elements.



For example, if element “Foo” exists in Site A and Site B, and element “Bar” exists in Site B and Site C,
and this is set to `['c', 'b', 'a']`, then Foo will be returned for Site B, and Bar will be returned
for Site C.

If this isn’t set, then preference goes to the current site.



::: code
```twig
{# Fetch unique products from Site A, or Site B if they don’t exist in Site A #}
{% set products = craft.products()
  .site('*')
  .unique()
  .preferSites(['a', 'b'])
  .all() %}
```

```php
// Fetch unique products from Site A, or Site B if they don’t exist in Site A
$products = \craft\commerce\elements\Product::find()
    ->site('*')
    ->unique()
    ->preferSites(['a', 'b'])
    ->all();
```

See [Relations](https://craftcms.com/docs/4.x/relations.html) for a full explanation of how to work with this parameter.

{% set products = craft.products()
  .relatedTo(myCategory)
  .all() %}
```

```php
// Fetch all products that are related to $myCategory
$products = \craft\commerce\elements\Product::find()
    ->relatedTo($myCategory)
    ->all();
```
:::


<h4 id="product-render"><a href="#product-render" class="header-anchor">#</a> <code>render</code></h4>

Executes the query and renders the resulting elements using their partial templates.

If no partial template exists for an element, its string representation will be output instead.

only want unique elements to be returned, use [unique](#product-unique) in conjunction with this.
