# Front-End Basics

Now that we’ve set up enough tools to manage a pool of content, it’s time to build a “front-end” presentation for visitors.

This process involves three concepts:

1. Craft’s request and response lifecycle;
1. Querying for content created via the admin;
1. Interspersing that content with HTML (and styling the output with CSS);

Craft supports two fundamentally different approaches to building a front-end:

1. **Monolithic:** Using templates to generate HTML on the server;
1. **Headless:** Using GraphQL in conjunction with a separate front-end view library;

::: tip
Both methods give you complete access to your content. You are free to choose one of these approaches, combine aspects that suit your project, switch between them at a later date, deploy both for different audiences, or come up with your own hybrid architecture!

Craft doesn’t dictate _anything_ about how you consume your content—in fact, it can be used as a back-end for a native application or kiosk, a bare API… or have no front-end at all, and exist solely as a warehouse for structured data.

This tutorial will focus on a “monolithic” architecture, due to its lack of external dependencies—however, we will touch on the [GraphQL API](../more/graphql.md) in the _More_ section.

We’ll start by fixing the “404 Not Found” error we faced after creating our first blog post.
